# Maquetaci√≥ II

Bootstrap responsive landing page using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as bundler. Minimal use of [GSAP](https://greensock.com/3/) for fade in animations. The design isn't mine. This is an assignment of the IT Academy course to practice Bootstrap and Sass.

## Structure

There's a commit for each exercice. I added a Bonus, in which I've added a mobile menu and fade-in animations.

## Available Scripts

```
npm run dev
```

It runs the site on development mode and sets a local server at http://localhost:1234 to visit the site.

```
npm run build
```

It generates all assets for deployment in the `dist` folder.
The files are optimized to reduce space and hashes are employed in filenames to improve chaching.
